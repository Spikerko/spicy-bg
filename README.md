# ‚ö†Ô∏è This Extension Will No Longer Be Updated

I want to let you know that I will **no longer be maintaining this extension**.  

### Recommended Alternative
If you‚Äôre looking for a great replacement, I personally recommend [Glassify](https://github.com/sanoojes/spicetify-glassify) ‚Äî it‚Äôs an excellent alternative!

### Why I'm Pausing Development
1. I simply don‚Äôt have enough time. ‚è≥  
2. My main focus right now is [Spicy Lyrics](https://github.com/Spikerko/spicy-lyrics), which I‚Äôm dedicating most of my energy to.

I‚Äôm truly sorry if this disappoints you, but I hope you understand that I also have other commitments.  

Thanks for all your support, and I wish you the best! üëã
